Furthermore, existing methods for recycling PV modules are frequently unsuitable and inefficient.</p>
                <p>The department for Technology, Innovation, and Enterprise at SP has successfully developed a patented technology that allows for the recovery of all valuable materials from crystalline silicon PV modules using environmentally-friendly processes. With this innovative approach, the PV panels are not crushed, enabling the recovery of the glass intact, while the silicon substrate can be retrieved in separate pieces instead of being reduced to a powdered mixture. Additionally, all valuable substances extracted from the PV modules become high-value products, and the proprietary etchants used are gentle and can be reused for multiple extraction batches.

                            the sustainable industry to aid in acheiving the Singapore Green Plan 2023 and the UNSDGs. As a student, they
                            had provided us a fine education via (Common Core Corriculum) to enhacned the knowledge of us student on the 
                            sutainability plan and also gaves us a provision on what a sustainable future is. Me as one of the students 
                            of SP had a deep feeling that this strategy in planning modules are a success. We students get to relate 
                            environmental issues, sustainable matters onto our daily life and even our asignment. Through that this 
                            bathch of students would have a strong knowledge on the sustainable topic and hence would act as an imperative role
                            in the future in contributing towrads this green industry.<br><br>In conlusion, everyone of us have the responsibilities
                            to practice a sustainable lifestyle. My school and I had started their moves now it's your turn to make a move. 
                            Remember - "It's not a choice but a responsibilities of all." Start from now let's make a move
                            and save the Earth hand in hand.
